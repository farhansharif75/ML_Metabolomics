Supervised ML implementation on preprocessed data, using 6 models:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression (LogReg)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Simple (3-layer) Neural Network (SNN)

Vanilla models are used in all cases. No oversampling/undersampling is used in any case, and hyperparameter tuning is absent.
