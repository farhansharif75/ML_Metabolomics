Supervised ML implementation on preprocessed data, using 6 models:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression (LogReg)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Simple (3-layer) Neural Network (SNN)

Vanilla models are used in all cases. Oversampling using SMOTE and undersampling using RandomUnderSampler have been incorporated. Flexible hyperparameter tuning incorporated, allowing various methods for model tuning.
