    "We now incorporate oversampling and undersampling strategies into our supervised ML implementation. We will use `SMOTE` for oversampling and `RandomUnderSampler` for undersampling. These will be incorporated per CV split, post `StandardScaler`, but before `PCA`. In addition, we also include various methods for hyperparameter tuning, implemented per fold: `GridSearchCV`, `RandomisedSearchCV`, `BayesSearchCV`, and `HalvingSearchCV` (this last one is experimental). We introduce the usage of `SelectKBest` to feature selection to a specified number of features. We have also refactored the code so that a separate function handles the pre-processing."
