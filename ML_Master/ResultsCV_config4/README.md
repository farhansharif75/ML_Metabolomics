This folder contains the CV results for label configuration 4. This corresponds to the label assignment:
- 'Normal' : 0
- 'CIN1' : 1
- 'CIN2' : 2
- 'CGIN' : 3
- 'HPV INFECTION' : 4


This is the same as label configuration 0, however, the pipelines are constructed to perform One-vs-Rest (OVR) classification instead of straight multiclass.
