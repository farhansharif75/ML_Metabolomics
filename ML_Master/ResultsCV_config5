This folder contains the CV results for label configuration 5. This corresponds to the label assignment:
- 'Normal, HPV INFECTION' : 0
- 'CIN1' : 1
- 'CIN2, CGIN' : 2


This is the same as label configuration 3, however, the pipelines are constructed to perform One-vs-Rest (OvR) classification instead of straight multiclass.
